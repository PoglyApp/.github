## What is [Pogly](https://pogly.gg) Standalone?

Pogly standalone at its core is an overlay tool for streamers.

It allows the streamer to condense their cluttered OBS scene heirarchy into a single, powerful, overlay browser source. With a Pogly extensions, plug directly in to [StreamLabels](https://streamlabs.com/desktop-widgets/stream-labels), Spotify, Discord, and many other supported apps.

In addition, Pogly standalone allows streamers to *hand off* the hassle of updating their overlays to trusted third parties, like their stream or discord moderators. These changes can be made concurrently by multiple users and are applied real-time without any streamer interaction or need to refresh OBS sources.

**\<example video/webm soon>**

## How does Cloud differ?

Pogly Cloud is a managed offering of Pogly, where we handle the hosting, and scaling of your Pogly Standalone instance.

This product offering will be available in two flavors: a free version with a feature parity to Pogly Standalone*, and a subscription-based premium version. The premium version, in addition to having unlimited storage space, will also come with other premium features not found in Pogly Standalone, such as: advanced editor permissions, streamer-safe AI image recognition, advanced image editing features, viewer/chat integration via Pogly bot and chat commands, etc. Subject to change.

\* The free tier of Pogly Cloud will maintain feature parity with Pogly Standalone except for storage. This hasn't been fully decided and is subject to change.

## More Information

More information will be available in the Pogly Standalone repository, currently private, when we launch 1.0 ðŸŽ‰
